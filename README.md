### 🏎️ F1 Dashboard (Passion Project)_v2

This is a personal passion project where I’m building a compact and visually appealing Formula 1 dashboard that displays:

🏑 Latest race results

🥇 Driver championship standings

🏢 Constructor standings

### 🌟 Purpose

As a Formula 1 fan, I wanted a lightweight dashboard I could open while watching races to track my favorite drivers and teams in real-time. The goal is to eventually expand this into a more dynamic live tracker.

### 🤖 Built with AI

This project is being written with the help of Perplexity, bolt.new and ChatGPT, which assists in writing and refining React code, CSS layout, and API integration.

### 🔌 APIs Used

Jolpica Ergast API – for race results, standings, and championship data

CountryFlagsAPI – for displaying driver national flags (later additions)

### 💠 Tech Stack

⚛️ React 18 (with functional components)
⚡ Vite (for development/build tooling)
📘 TypeScript (typed React code)
🎨 Vanilla CSS (responsive, mobile-first styles)
🤖 AI-assisted coding (bolt.new, Perplexity, ChatGPT)
☁️ GitHub for version control and deployment
